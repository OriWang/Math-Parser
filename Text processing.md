**Text processing**

- Convert different forms of a word into same index term

- Used in ctrl/cmd + F to find words in a page

- Why text processing? Exact text matching has restrictions:

- - Case sensitivity
  - Punctuation: Striping punctuations increases probability that you find a match
  - Tense/forms of words

- Text processing aims to increase the probability of word match.
